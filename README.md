You didn't think that halloween could get any better. Free candy, costumes, and the Great Pumpkin. Think again, this game will make your holiday better than you ever could have imagined.

Created with two friends my first semester of college (Fall 2019) as part of HackerSociety's October Python Month. This program is built upon a program my friend created for a highschool python class. On top of his old program we made the game 2-player instead of single player and added the Halloween theme. We met multiple times throughout the month and switched off who was driving (coding) and who was navigating (observing and helping out).
