# TrickOrTag
Created with two friends my first semester of college (Fall 2019) as part of HackerSociety's October Python Month. This program is built upon a program my friend created for a highschool python class. On top of his old program we made the game 2-player instead of single player and added the Halloween theme. We met multiple times throughout the month and switched off who was driving (coding) and who was navigating (observing and helping out). At the end of the month we presented our project to the rest of the club!
